# Basic Python Tutorial
 This is a tutorial made to teach you some basic Python commands as well as a little bit of basic computer science to expand your knowledge on programming.


 I recommend using Visual Studio Code, as that is the program that this was made in. It should garner more favorable results.


 As will be stated in the menu, use the number keys 1-8 to navigate through the different sections, and use 9 to exit the program.

 To create a new terminal in order to use the program, press Crtl+shift+`, or alternatively, click the 'Terminal' button located to the left of the 'Help' button at the top of the window, then click 'New Terminal'. It should appear at the bottom of the window.

 Afterwards, in order to run the program, you must type the command "python Main.py". The menu should immediately appear below.

 If your terminal gets too overcrowded with text, type "cls" into the command line. This should clear your terminal.
